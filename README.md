##Overview

Install and manage TSM (Tivoli Storage Manager) client with puppet. It's
heavily inspired by the puppetlabs-ntp module.

This is currently work in progress!

##Module Description

This module handles installing, configuring and running the IBM Tivoli
Storage Manager (TSM) client on the following operating systems:

* RedHat Linux
* Solaris 10
* Solaris 11

##Setup

### What tsm effects

* TSM package (TIVsm-Ba and TIVsm-API)
* TSM configuration files (dsm.sys and InclExcl)
* TSM service (dsmsched)

###Setup requirements

For RedHat Linux you need a yum repository that includes the rpm
packages from the IBM provided installation tar.gz.

This usually are

* TIVsm-API64.x86_64.rpm
* gskssl64-8.0.14.26.linux.x86_64.rpm
* gskcrypt64-8.0.14.26.linux.x86_64.rpm
* TIVsm-BA.x86_64.rpm

For Solaris 10 and 11 you need a HTTP server that provides the
following packages for downloading:

* TIVsmCapi.pkg
* TIVsmCba.pkg
* gsk8cry32.pkg
* gsk8cry64.pkg
* gsk8ssl32.pkg
* gsk8ssl64.pkg

The gsk package are usually provided as file systems packages (thanks
IBM!) so you have to translate them with pkgtrans:

  $ pkgtrans . gskssl32.pkg gsk8ssl32/

and copy them to you HTTP download location. You are going to need two
download locations one for sparc and one for i386 (see params.pp for
an example).

###Beginning with tsm

Include class TSM on hosts where you would like to install the TSM
client packages. By default no config files will be overridden. The
TSM class just makes sure the TSM packages are installed.

##Usage

All available options (see [params.pp](manifests/params.pp)) should be
changed via the main tsm class.

##Reference

Please see [params.pp](manifests/params.pp) for an explanation of all available options

##Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 3.1.0 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

    RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6
    Solaris 10 i386/sparc
    Solaris 11 i386/sparc
